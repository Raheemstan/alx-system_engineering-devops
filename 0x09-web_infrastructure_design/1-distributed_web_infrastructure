Additional Elements:
        Database Replica: Ensures data redundancy and failover capability.
        Load Balancer: Distributes incoming traffic among multiple servers for improved performance and scalability.

    Load Balancer Algorithm: Configured with Round Robin distribution for even traffic distribution among servers.

    Active-Active/Active-Passive Setup: Employing an Active-Passive setup where the load balancer distributes traffic among active servers, and in case of failure, switches to the passive server.

    Database Primary-Replica Cluster:
        Primary Node: Handles write operations, maintaining the original dataset.
        Replica Node: Synchronizes data from the primary node and serves as a backup. It handles read operations to reduce the load on the primary node and ensure data availability if the primary fails.

Issues:

    Single Points of Failure (SPOF):
        Database Primary Server: If it fails, there might be data loss until the replica takes over.
        Load Balancer: If it fails, the system becomes inaccessible.
    Security Issues:
        Lack of Firewalls: Increases vulnerability to unauthorized access.
        No HTTPS: Data transmission is not encrypted, risking data integrity and privacy.
    No Monitoring:
        Absence of monitoring tools to track system health, performance, and security.

Potential Improvements:

    Implement Firewalls: Enhance security by configuring firewalls to filter incoming and outgoing traffic.
    Enable HTTPS: Encrypt data transmission to protect user privacy and data integrity.
    Implement Monitoring Tools: Deploy monitoring solutions to track system health, detect anomalies, and ensure uptime.
