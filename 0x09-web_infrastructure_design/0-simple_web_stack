Definitions:

    Server:
        A server, whether physical, virtual, or a computer program, provides functionality to other programs or devices known as "clients".

    Role of a Domain Name:
        A domain name serves to identify Internet resources, including computers, networks, and services, using a text-based label that is simpler to memorize than numerical addresses (IP addresses).

    Type of DNS Record "www" in "www.foobar.com":
        It is a 'CNAME' (Canonical Name) record.

    Role of the Web Server:
        A Web Server stores, processes, and displays website contents (codebase), delivering web pages to users primarily composed of HTML and CSS over the HTTP protocol.

    Role of the Application Server:
        An Application Server generates dynamic contents by executing server-side code such as JSP, Ajax, PHP, etc.

    Role of the Database:
        The Database manages data systematically and efficiently in an organized manner, facilitating easy addition, access, update, management, and deletion of data.

    Communication between Server and User's Computer Requesting the Website:
        The server communicates through the HTTP protocol.

Issues:

A. SPOF (Single Point Of Failure):

    Multiple single points of failures exist, beginning with having a single server housing only one web server, application server, and database. A single point of failure, if it fails, can halt the entire system.

B. Downtime during Maintenance:

    The downtime during maintenance, like deploying new code where the web server needs a restart, might exceed expectations. As the server depends on a single code base, its unavailability affects user access to the website's content, resulting in a poor user experience and loss of traffic.

C. Scaling Limitation with High Traffic:

    Due to the domain name directly pointing to the server without a load balancer, handling increased loads becomes challenging. This limitation affects the website's ability to accommodate high volumes of users, potentially leading to a poor user experience or setting a cap on user capacity.
